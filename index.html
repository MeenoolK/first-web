        <p>McCoy spent his younger years studying medicine in England. When he finished his studies, he was looking for an adventure which made him sail to the new world. He crossed the Atlantic and set foot on the American shore. There, he was forcibly recruited to fight in the American Civil War. He fought and worked as a doctor alike but could not stand the horror and the futility of the war, so he deserted after a year of service and became a gun for hire.</p>

        <p> Doc's experience of war has turned him into a cynical disillusioned man. The long scar on his face lends him a grimly threatening appearance to the people which is accentuated by his preference for black clothing.</p>
